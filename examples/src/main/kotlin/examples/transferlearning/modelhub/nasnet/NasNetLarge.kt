 * This examples demonstrates the inference concept on NasNetLarge model:
 * - Model configuration, model weights and labels are obtained from [TFModelHub].
 * - Weights are loaded from .h5 file, configuration is loaded from .json file.
 * - Model predicts on a few images located in resources.
 * - Special preprocessing (used in NasNetLarge during training on ImageNet dataset) is applied to each image before prediction.
 *
 * NOTE: Input resolution is 331*331
