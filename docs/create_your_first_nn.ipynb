    "Thus the input will be an array of size 28 x 28 x 1 where each value in the array\n",

    "* `activation = Activations.Relu`. Simply put, in a neuron, a weighted sum of the inputs plus bias is calculated, then an activation function is applied. \n",

    "* `kernelInitializer = HeNormal()`, `biasInitializer = HeUniform()`. Before a neural network is trained, all the parameters need to be initialized. \n",
