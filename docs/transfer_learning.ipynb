    "# Transfer learning with KotlinDL\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a popular deep learning technique that allows you to save time on training a neural network while achieving great performance too. \n",
    "It leverages existing pre-trained models and allows you to tweak them to your task by training only a part of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will take a pre-trained VGG-19 Keras model that has been trained on a large dataset (ImageNet) to classify color images into 1000 categories. \n",
    "We will load this model with KotlinDL, and fine-tune it by training only some of its layers to classify images from our own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we downloaded a dataset containing images of dogs and cats \n",
    "(it's a subset of the dataset from the famous Kaggle competition with only 50 images per class instead of 12500 images per class like the original dataset). \n",
    "Next, we resized the images to be 224 x 224 pixels. This is the same image size as VGG-19 was trained on. \n",
    "It is important for all the images to be the same size, however, \n",
    "it is not critical for them to be of the exact size as what the model was trained on – if needed, we can replace the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've stored the image dataset so each class is in its own folder: \n",
    "```\n",
    "small-catdogs/\n",
    "    cat/\n",
    "    dogs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are, of course, many ways to organize your own dataset. \n",
    "This way makes it easier to get the labels for all the examples based on the folder names \n",
    "(we assume that the folder with the name _cat_ contains images of cats).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to create a `Dataset` from these images. \n",
    "You can do so via the Image Preprocessing Pipeline description, and building a dataset from those. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's code that will go through a folder structure received via ```catDogsSmallDatasetPath()```, loads and resizes the images, and applies the VGG-19 specific preprocessing."
